This project is related to a *QuestionAnswering* system where users can post a question and get back answers also they can answer to a question already posted.

This is a school project developed for one of the classes using _PHP_ and _MySql_ database. 

It was just hosted on school website and the code was written in 2014.

A lot changed in PHP since then - users can download the site and use the following sql scripts to create tables. 

Users need to update the database name and schema along with db server name, username and password on all Php files.

There can be a lot of improvements. Any suggentions/feedback are welcome. Again this is a sample website meant to start as a base.
